# 📊 Socio-Economic Household Data Analysis  
## Descriptive Statistics & Distribution Analysis
---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **descriptive statistical analysis** of socio-economic household data.  
It focuses on understanding **income distribution, education impact, demographic patterns, and variability** using statistical concepts and visualizations.

The project is designed as an **academic + portfolio-ready data analysis project**, demonstrating strong foundations in:
- Statistics
- Data understanding
- Visualization
- Interpretation of real-world data


## 🎯 Objective  
This project analyzes household-level data to understand patterns related to **income, age, education level, family size, and living conditions**.

The objective is to:
- Identify types of data (Numerical & Categorical)
- Apply descriptive statistical techniques
- Analyze income distribution
- Measure skewness and kurtosis
- Visualize socio-economic trends using Python
